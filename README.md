# Coffee Shop Analysis project
This project focuses on leveraging Python to analyze and visualize data for optimizing the performance of a coffee shop. Using the libraries **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, it involves exploring sales patterns through line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, box plots, and violin plots. The project also includes the creation of an advanced dashboard showcasing key insights, such as sales trends, product profitability, and the relationship between temperature and coffee sales. By combining these visualizations, the project provides actionable strategies to improve decision-making and business outcomes for the coffee shop.
